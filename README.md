| Option | Description | Additional Details |
|:--------:|:-------------|:--------------------|
|`Code`|Insert a blank line of code.|You can insert a code line before, after, or between text lines.|
|`Section Break`|Insert a section break.|You can insert a section break to divide your live script or function into manageable sections to evaluate individually. A section can consist of code, text, and output. For more information, see Create and Run Sections in Code.|
| `Text`  |    Insert a blank line of text.         |     A text line can contain formatted text, hyperlinks, images, or equations. You can insert a text line before, after, or between code lines.               |
|   `Table of Contents`     |      Insert a table of contents.       |  The table of contents contains a list of all the titles and headings in the document. If the document contains only one title, then it is not included in the table of contents. Only the title of the table of contents is editable. You can insert a table of contents only in text lines. If you insert a table of contents into a code line, MATLAB® places it directly above the current code section. When exporting a live script containing a table of contents to Microsoft® Word, by default, the table of contents in the resulting document does not include page numbers. To add page numbers, click the table of contents and select Update Table.              |
|    `Code Example`    |   Insert a formatted code example.          |      A code example is sample code that appears as indented and monospaced text.`Select Plain to insert sample code as unhighlighted text.` ` Select MATLAB to insert sample code as text highlighted according to MATLAB syntax.`              |
|   `Table`     |   Insert a table.          |       You can insert tables only in text lines. If you insert a table into a code line, MATLAB places the table in a new text line directly under the selected code line. To specify the table size, select Table drop-down arrow, move the cursor over the grid to highlight the numbers of rows and columns you want, and click to add the table. To create a larger table, click the table button , and specify the numbers of rows and columns in the dialog box. After inserting the table, you can modify its rows and columns: `Insert or delete rows and columns` — Right-click the table, select **Table**, and then select from the available insertion and deletion options. `Resize columns` — Click and drag the edge of the column. To reset the column widths, right-click and select **Table** > **Reset Column Widths**. `Make the first row a header row` — Right-click the table and select **Table** > **Turn Header Row On.**             |
